# DU Bootcamp Challenge #4 - Quiz Project

Link to live project: https://yohuck.github.io/quiz-game/

For this project, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web/browser APIs like setInterval() and Google fonts to create an interactive JavaScript quiz that includes a timer, scoring, and local memory storage of scores. 

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
